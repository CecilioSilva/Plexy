  <p>Plexy connects your plex server to your discord server. 
    By sending messages to a certain discord channel when new content is added. 
    And enabling users to look trough and get info about the plex server.

# Features ‚ú®

Plexy is a one of a kind discord bot

- Easy to use ‚öíÔ∏è
- Easy to configure ‚öôÔ∏è
- Customizable üìê
- Two different modes
---

## How to use Plexy ü§ñ
### Requirements üìú

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6 or Higher (I used 3.9)
- A Plex admin account
- Discord account
- [Latest release](https://github.com/CecilioSilva/Plexy/releases/latest)

---

##### 1. Make your own discord bot

First go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
login with your discord account
press `new application`
type the application name and press `Create`
set your application/bot icon and description/about me
choose form the navbar in the left `Bot` option
press `add bot` and `yes, do it!`

##### 2. make sure you have [Python 3.6 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed

##### 3. Download [latest release](https://github.com/CecilioSilva/Plexy/releases/latest)

##### 4. Login to plex with an admin account

##### 5. Unzip the source files and locate `configs/secrets.example.json` it should look like this:

```json
{
  "bot_token": "<Bot Token>",
  "notificationsChannelId": 1000000000000000000,
  "plexAdminDiscordId": 1000000000000000000,
  "plexBaseUrl": "<Plex Base Url>",
  "plexToken": "<Plex X-Token>",
  "contentUrl": "<Plex Content URL>"
}
```

- `bot_token` &#8594; The discord bot token you can find in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)  
- `notificationChannelid` &#8594; Go to discord client `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Developer Mode` and enable it. Then go to the channel you want the new content notifications and right click it and `Copy ID`  
- `plexAdminDiscordId` &#8594; Do the same as `notificationChannelid` but select the discord user you that controls the plex server
- `plexBaseUrl` &#8594; Go to [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) and open the dashboard. goto `Settings` > `Remote Access` if plex server is on the same system as the bot use `http://localhost:32400/`, otherwise use the public ip and port
- `plexToken` &#8594; See [Finding an authentication token / X-Plex-Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/)
- `contentUrl` &#8594; Go to the [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) Dashboard and open a media item. then in the address-bar copy everything until `/details`  
  ![Content-url](https://i.imgur.com/iL1Bl6S.png)

##### 6. Rename the file to `secrets.json`

##### 7. Open `configs/config.example.json`

```json
  "plex_config": {
    "refreshTime": 15,
    "max-recently-added": 20,
    "scanLibraries": ["TV Shows", "Movies", "Anime"],
    "allLibraries": ["Anime", "Movies", "Home videos", "TV Shows"]
  }
```
- `scanLibraries` &#8594; Are all the libraries Plexy searches for new content
- `allLibraries` &#8594; All the libraries you want plexy to see

```json
"args": {
  "-all": ["Anime", "Movies", "TV Shows"],
  "-movie": ["Movies"],
  "-m": ["Movies"],
  "-show": ["TV Shows"],
  "-s": ["TV Shows"],
  "-anime": ["Anime"],
  "-a": ["Anime"],
  "-h": ["Home videos"],
  "-videos": ["Videos"],
  "-v": ["Videos"]
}
```
These are all the flags users can use to filter for libraries
you can add and remove any flag you want


#### 8. Choose if you want safe mode or not


| :exclamation:  This is very important   |
|-----------------------------------------|

```json
  "general_config" : {
    "safe-mode": true
  }
```

**üõë Plexy uses the plex token to get media assets from the plex server. 
But that exposes the plex token you have set to everybody in the discord server/channel. üõë**
         



#### 9. Rename the file to `config.json`
