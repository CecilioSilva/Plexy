How to use plexy:

Requirements:
 1. Python 3.6 or Higher (3.9 recommended)
 2. Plex admin account
 3. Discord account

Steps:

1. Make a bot account in the discord developer portal.

2. Make sure you have python installed and pip is working.

3. Open "secrets.example.json" and fill in every field (for more info look at git repo).

4. Save and rename "secrets.example.json" to "secrets.json".

5. Open "config.example.json" and change "scanLibraries", "allLibraries", "args" to your Plex library names.

6. *IMPORTANT* "safe_mode" if "true" Plexy uses the plex token to get media assets from the plex server.
    But that exposes the plex token you have set to everybody in the discord server/channel.

7. Change any other settings you want and Save and rename "config.example.json" to "config.json".

8. (OPTIONAL) make a virtual enviorment

8.1 Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies

9. Use `python Bot.py` to run the bot
